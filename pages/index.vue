    otherExperienceMd: `During my final year in high school I started working on my own **simple operating system** using **C** and **x86 ASM** for learning purposes. It did not have a GUI but supported memory pagination and had a very simple shell with colour support.\n\nWhile studying at **Ko√ß University** I worked on some projects for the university itself. I have designed and developed **KURadyo**, the official radio application of my school's radio club, for Android and iOS using **Titanium Mobile**. I have also made the website of numerous other school clubs using mainly **PHP** and **MySQL** for server-side development.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012 I have developed and maintained two Mac apps for the **Mac App Store**. The first one, **Code Minifier**, automatically detected and minified html, css, and js files. The highest ranking it got was being the **#3 top paid** developer app in Turkey. My second Mac app was **iMemoryCleaner**, the first inactive memory cleaning app to hit the Mac App Store. It managed to enter the **top 10** paid apps list **in several countries**. After not having the time to release any kind of updates for these apps (as I worked on more important projects and on finishing my school) for a considerable amount of time, I decided not to renew my Mac developer license.\n\nIn years 2012 and 2013 I have joined the **game jams** named **TGJ** and **GGJ** respectively. Acted as both the **game designer** and a **programmer** in the former; was the sole programmer in the latter.\n\nAnother project of mine that is worth mentioning here is my **Mac OS X port** of the popular Nintendo DS & GBA emulator named **No$GBA**. It has so far been **downloaded more than 160 000 times** and **featured on** sites like **Reddit**.`,
